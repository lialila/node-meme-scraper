# Node.js Meme Scraper

This programm creates a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes the current version of this website:
https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/ and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project. The image files are named with a number with a leading zero, eg. 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc.

The program should be able to run multiple times without throwing an error.
